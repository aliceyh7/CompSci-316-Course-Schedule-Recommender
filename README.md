Daniel Zeng, Muchang Bahng, Abhishek Chataut, Alice Hu, Jasper Hu 

## Progress Report 

### Sep 23, 2024

Muchang looked through course websites to possible ways we can webscrape the relevent data.   
Abhishesk and Daniel found and used a Duke API that allows us to retrieve a subset of the relevant data we need. 
Jasper and Alice brainstormed additional functionalities of our platform and how we can get sufficient interaction with the DBMS, in particular updating the database.
